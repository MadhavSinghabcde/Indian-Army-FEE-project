                scheme, accommodation on concessional rent, canteen facilities, group housing scheme, family<br>
                assistance scheme, etc.<br>
                The pension amount at retirement is usually calculated as 50% of the last drawn salary.<br>
                The pension continues for the spouse and dependants even after the death of the pensioner,<br>
                 subject to age and income conditions. The pension in such cases is capped at 30% of the last drawn salary.<br>
                Health insurance: Healthcare facilities, including hospitalization for serious ailments,<br>
                 is provided for serving personnel and their dependants. For places where the facilities do<br>
                  not have specialist healthcare services, healthcare expenditure done elsewhere is reimbursed by the government.<br>
                <br>
                For retired personnel of the armed forces, there is an ex-servicemen contributory health scheme <br>
                (ECHS). Retiring personnel need to pay a lump sum to join the scheme. The lump sum amount is ₹1.2 lakh<br>
                for officers, ₹67,000 for junior commissioned officers (JCOs) and ₹30,000 for jawans. The scheme<br>
                is available for all ex-servicemen, including those from the Army, Navy, Air Force and Indian Coast<br>
                Guard, among others. The scheme also covers ex-servicemen's dependants, including spouse, parents and children,<br>
                subject to some income, age and marital status conditions. However, children having a permanent disability who cannot <br>
                earn a living are covered, irrespective of age. Minor siblings of the ex-servicemen are also covered up to 18 years of age.<br>
                These facilities can be availed at all the hospitals owned by the armed forces as well as empanelled<br>
                hospitals across the country. Also, there is no upper limit to the benefit.<br>
                Army canteens: The ministry of defence has a Canteen Stores Department that ties up with manufacturers<br>
                and provides goods at a discounted price to armed forces personnel. While the discounts have reduced over<br>
                the past few years with the introduction of taxes on these stores and increase in online discounts,<br>
                some big-ticket purchases can still be bought at a discount from these stores. For instance, you can<br>
                get a mid-range sports utility vehicle at a 10% discount to the actual market price.<br>
                Many banks in India have come up with special loan schemes for the army and defence<br>
                personnel of the nation. These loan schemes offer finances to defence personnel's to suit their<br>
                loan requirements. There are different kinds of loans especially for the defence personnel<br>
                including personal and home loans. Let us look into loans for defence personnel in India.<br>
